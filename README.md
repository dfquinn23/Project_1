Project 1 Stuff

Initial Idea:

Project idea: Homebuilder Strategy
Datasets:
•	Census data – look at for lower growth areas of above-average growth states

•	Regional economic accounts from the BEA (“… the geographic distribution of U.S. economic activity and growth. The estimates of gross domestic product by state and state and local area personal income, and the accompanying detail, provide a consistent framework for analyzing and comparing individual state and local area economies.”

•	Use BEA data to uncover areas that are primed for future growth
Using Census data
1.	Sort the 50 states by population growth
2.	Take the top 10 and break each state down by county population growth 
Using BEA data, we can:
1.	Rank the states by economic growth
2.	Take the top 10 and do county-level economic rankings
3.	Additionally, we can search by the growth in real estate values
Data visualizations: we can do final screens and create some charts and graphs that reconcile the two datasets to find the, let’s say, the 20 most promising investment areas (high top-line growth, slowest real estate value growth)

The project has to be saleable – it’s not a theoretical exercise:
•	Base assumption is that it’s a 2-week project
•	Let’s assume our “company” does 20 2-week projects per year
•	[(Salaries X 5)  / 20] + $1,000 ($20K in company overhead annually, divided by 20 – we run a tight ship.)
•	Add in a profit margin of 25%
We need to do a cost-benefit analysis for the client:
•	What problem are we solving?
•	How does our solution enable more precise decision-making for our client?
•	We should provide an idea/s on how improved decision-making leads to better business outcomes, vis-à-vis our “product.
•	Can we justify our total fee against what the ultimate value is for the client?
